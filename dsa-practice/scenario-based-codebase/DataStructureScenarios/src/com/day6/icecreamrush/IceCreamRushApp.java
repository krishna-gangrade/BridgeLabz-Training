/*
 1. IceCreamRush – Sorting Flavors by Popularity (Bubble Sort)
Story: 
	● At “IceCreamRush,” a small local vendor sells 8 different ice cream flavors. 
	● At the end of each week, the shopkeeper wants to sort these flavors based on how many times each was sold. 
	● Since the list is short and he updates it manually, he prefers a simple sorting method —
	● Bubble Sort — where he repeatedly compares adjacent sales figures and swaps them if Needed.
Concepts Involved:
	● Bubble Sort
	● Small data size
	● Repeated adjacent comparisons

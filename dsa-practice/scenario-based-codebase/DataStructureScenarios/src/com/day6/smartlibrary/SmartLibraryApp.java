/*
2. SmartLibrary – Auto-Sort Borrowed Books (Insertion Sort)
Story: 
	● A digital kiosk in a library maintains a list of books a user has borrowed. 
	● Every time a new book is issued, the system adds it to the user's list 
	  while keeping it alphabetically sorted by title. 
	● Since insertions are done one at a time, and the list is usually already sorted, 
	  Insertion Sort is the perfect fit.
Concepts Involved:
	● Insertion Sort
	● Dynamic list insertion
	● Nearly sorted data

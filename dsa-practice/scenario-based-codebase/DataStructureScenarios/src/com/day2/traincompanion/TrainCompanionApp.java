/*
5. TrainCompanion – Compartment Navigation System (Doubly Linked List)
Story: 
	● In a long-distance train app, passengers can walk to the next or previous compartment, or search for services (like pantry, WiFi). 
	● Each compartment is a node in a Doubly Linked List.
Requirements:
	● Traverse forward or backward.
	● Insert/Remove compartments dynamically.
	● Display adjacent compartments for quick decisions.
